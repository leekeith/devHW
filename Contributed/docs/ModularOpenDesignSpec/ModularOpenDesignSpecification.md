# The devEco devHW Open Modular Design Specification - Preliminary  Proposal

## Table of Contents

## Summary

This document is an initial draft of the devEco devHW Modular Open Design Specification. It will describe the process required to develop functional design units, or modules that can be combined together to create a valid schematic and layout with minimal electronics design knowledge or experience.

## Introduction

Modular design has been beneficial to many industries. Construction, motor vehicles, software development and aerospace all benefit from breaking complex systems down into functional, modular components. the devHW-MODS initiative strives to apply this design strategy to PCB design for the benefit of hobbyists, embedded developers, and the Open Hardware community.

### Why PCB Design

PCB design has a notoriously high barrier to entry compared to many adjacent disciplines. Not only does it require a solid education in circuit analysis, and a good understanding of materials Science, but the tools themselves are necessarily complex.

Unfortunately, it is also something that stands in the way of many developers with innovative, creative, or even world-changing ideas. Modular open PCB design aims to do for the embedded developerwhat Arduino did for artists and creators. If they are given tools that abstract away the majority of the complexity, they have the opportunity to create something amazing.

### Why Open

In order to truly foster growth in embedded technology, the tools cannot be locked to closed intellectual property.
